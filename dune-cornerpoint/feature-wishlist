Required functionality:
=======================

  - Parallelism.
  - Compressibility.

Desired functionality:
======================

  - FaceIterator-dependent boundary condition value query methods.
  - CFL-condition for capillary effects.

Other wishes:
=============

  - Combine all created libraries into one.
  - DuMux integration (for capillary, thermal, miscibility effects).
  - Quick TPFA incompressible solver w/capillary effects.
